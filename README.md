% This library is my adaptation of the Polytechnic Institute of New York
% University MATLAB Complex Dual Tree Wavelet Implementation:
% http://eeweb.poly.edu/iselesni/WaveletSoftware/
%
% This adaptation has recoded the Poly implementation to be much faster
% and more memory efficient, as well as some additional improvements.
% This recoding work was originally done while I was in grad school at the
% Rochester Institute of Technology.

% image denoising see JJL_den2D.m.
